To answer the research questions, we suggest a working hypothesis that authenticity of a toured object for Chinese inbound tourists is a result of tourists' projection of their basic physical experience on a toured object. We assume that an authentic toured object is viewed by Chinese tourists as a bounded entity and they `locate' a toured object on the surface in spatial dimensions. 

The paper analyses the text corpus of Chinese inbound tourists' reviews who have visited tourist attractions in Russia. The attractions appear to bear distinct stereotyped ethnic and local attributes, e.g. bears, birches, hard liquors, endemic products, ethnic huts. The corpus includes reviews of Russian-style restaurants, museums, gift shops, and ethnic parks. The data was sourced from Tripadvisor, a global platform with user-generated content (See Appendix 1). 

First, 3326 lexical units from 18 reviews of Russian-style museums, restaurants, gift shops and ethnic theme parks were subjected to examination. The sample consisted of two types of toured places: the brand new tourist attractions that have appeared within 5-7 years from now; the tourist places that have been run for more than 10 years and were renovated not long ago for tourist purposes (See Appendix 1). Moreover, the tourist attractions under study share one specific feature: they seem to function as exhibition centers of the local or perceived-to-be local objects that are designated in the research literature as traveler-objects (Lury, 1997). A detailed description of a typical tourist place, located in Vladivostok (Russia) is given in Appendix 2. 

Originally the reviews selected were written in Chinese language by Chinese mainland tourists but the specific tool applied in the research required an English language corpus. Therefore, Google translate, a machine translation service, was applied. In addition, two experts in Chinese language having linguistic background have checked the selected reviews for correctness. 

First, based on the objectivists' approach to authenticity, we made a list of distinctive features of authentic tourist attractions from the research papers on tourism authenticity. Objectivists argue that authentic tourist objects should bear a quality of the hand-made; be made from "natural" materials and by local people in a traditional fashion; not be manufactured for the 'mass' market; and be worth admiration (Sharpley, 1994; Trilling, 1972). Moreover, an authentic tourist attraction should be sacralized and enjoy ritual attitudes from tourists (MacCannell, 1976). Then, we manually tagged the metaphorical expressions that seemed to be relevant to the experience of authenticity according to the objectivist's features, checked their literal meanings registered in the Macmillan Online Dictionary. They appeared to share six components of meaning: religion, originality, place, time, scarceness and quality. In other words, the metaphors were grouped according to six semantic fields (See Table 1).

It should be noted that we were focused on selecting both literal and contextual metaphorical meanings (See Table 1). For this purpose we applied the Method Identification Procedure (the MIP) suggested by the Pragglejaz Group (2007).

Following this method, each text was divided into lexical units, and each lexical unit was compared to its contextual and basic meanings. If there was a discrepancy between a contextual and a basic meaning, a lexical unit was understood to be a metaphor. The basic meanings were defined through the online versions of the Macmillan Dictionary and Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English. Thus, the lexical unit 'world' in the context 'Quite a nice experience to come here and escape from the noisy world outside' is associated with tourists' routine and rationalized life-space opposed to their non-trivial and non-routine self of being in the toured space. However, the Macmillan Dictionary defines the item 'world' as 'the planet that we live on'. The comparison of contextual and basic meanings revealed the contrast and made it possible to mark the item 'world' as metaphorical. The selection procedure was limited by lexical units having metaphorical use. The cases of metonymy were excluded from the sample though they are figurative by nature. For example, Chinese inbound tourists described people who provided services to them as 'a textile girl' or 'a Cossack driver' that meant 'a waiter in a traditional Russian costume' and 'a taxi driver' respectively. Metaphorical units made up approximately 1.6% of the lexical units examined. Following the MIP guidelines, two linguists had to decide whether each unit from the compiled list of lexical units could be considered to be a metaphor. The linguists selected were metaphor experts; each of them was a non-native English speaker. The linguists had to work independently and identify both contextual and literal metaphors concerning the experience of authenticity by Chinese inbound tourists. The rationale for the expert metaphor identification was based on the assumption that a lack of criteria for contextual metaphor identification and different assumptions of individual experts could make it difficult to define a unit as a metaphor. There was a preliminary discussion with the experts on the ways of identifying contextual metaphors in discourse applying the procedure followed by a final discussion on the results of metaphor selection. After the identification procedure, there was a final discussion of the results, especially the cases which were not evident. 

There was a small group of cases that one of the expert coders tagged as non-metaphorical, accounting for about 10% of the data; and there was a larger group of units that both linguists considered to be metaphorical, making up about 40 % of the data. As the author was responsible for the initial metaphor selection procedure, there were no cases of full agreement on the metaphorical nature of the units among the expert coders.

In order to provide reliable results and to determine to what extent experts from the same field of study agree on the nature of the selected units, the result reliability was assessed with Cohen's Kappa method of calculation (Markert, Nissim, 2003; Pragglejaz Group, 2007). We measured the agreement among a pair of coders in terms of the observed and expected chance agreements and the method yielded a Kappa of 0.9. Following the interpretation by Markert and Nissam (2003), applied to the metonymy identification, the metaphor selection is reliable if a value is of 0.80 or higher. Cohen's Kappa method of calculation suggests further research on metaphor identification, involving a larger group of experts and naive coders to reduce possible errors in the assessment procedure. 

The third stage aimed to identify corresponding semantic categories the linguistic metaphors belonged to. First, the UCRELa Semantic Analysis System (USAS) of the Wmatrix corpus analysis and comparison tool was applied to assign semantic taggers to the linguistic metaphors selected. They are the so-called descriptive labels of the semantic categories and subcategories. The metaphorical units uploaded into the Wmatrix were examined to identify the domains that had to be a source for the metaphors later. We use the term 'a source domain', a concept related to the Conceptual Metaphor Theory (Lakoff, Johnson, 2001). In the study, source domains are represented as general discourse fields marked in the Wmatrix tool with the upper letter. A direct correspondence was determined between USAS source domains of authenticity
